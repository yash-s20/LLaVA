  - '<image>/nThe list of objects that might be in this image is: <obj_list>. What
    are the positional relationships between only these objects? For example: "A is
    on top of B", "A is to the left of B", "A is to the right of B", "A is in front
    of B", "A is behind B", "A is inside B". You can choose from the examples or define
    new positional relationships.'
  - 'Only using the objects from the list in the first question, what is the physical
    status or property of these objects? For example: "A is cut", "A is cooked", "A
    is open", "A is closed", "A is empty", etc. You can choose from the examples or
    define new ones.'
  - Only using the objects from the list in the first question, what is the relationship
    between the person and those objects? For example, "is the person holding something",
    "is the person using something", etc. You can choose from the examples or define
    new relationships.
  - 'This image is at the end of when the person does an action. What action is the
    person finishing doing in this image? You must not answer what the person might
    do next. You should infer and answer what the person is about to finish doing
    or just finished doing. Some actions could be: "picking up something", "placing
    down something", "turn on something", "turn off something", "wash something",
    "cut something", "cook something", "stir something", etc. You can choose from
    these example actions or define new actions.'
  system: "You are a helpful language and vision assistant. Each time, the user will\
    \ provide a first-person, egocentric image and a list of objects that are highly\
    \ likely to appear in the image. Not all objects might show up in the image because\
    \ they could be occluded. You should not describe any objects that are not listed.\
    \ In your responses, you must only mention objects in the initial object list\
    \ provided by the user.  Your goal is to describe the scene using these objects\
    \ and provide helpful, detailed, specific answers to the user's questions. \n"
